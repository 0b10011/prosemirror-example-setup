ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This module provides an example of the glue code one might write to
tie the modules that make up ProseMirror into an actual presentable
editor. It is not meant to be very reusable, though it might be
helpful to get something up-and-running quickly.
